Step 2. Preprocess the data as you see fit

Step 3. Split into 80% train 20% test

Step 4. Modify the model shown in the demo to take the new data

Step 5. Train the model on the data

Step 6. Make predictions on the test data and compare them to the test labels

Step 7. Calculate the accuracy of your results

Step 8. Hypothesize a change you can make to the model. Type out your hypothesis as comments in the code or in a text cell

Step 9. Test your hypothesis by training your edited model

Step 10. Show the results of your changed model by repeating steps 6 and 7. Discuss the differences if any
