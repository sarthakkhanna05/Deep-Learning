# Generate custom dataset and apply CNN model to detect each class. 

## I've used three classes in this assignment

Refer to demo_04-classification for examples on setting up a custom dataset.

Step 1. Create your own dataset featuring 3 custom categories of at least 100 images each (Run dataset generator.ipynb)

Step 2. Split this data between 80% training and 20% test

Step 3. Preprocess the data as you see fit

Step 4. Create a Convolutional Neural Network based model to learn on your training set 

Step 5. Make predictions on the test data and compare them to the expected categories
