# Deep-Learning
Deep neural networks and their applications to various problems, e.g., speech recognition, image segmentation, and natural language processing. Covers underlying theory, the range of applications to which it has been applied, and learning from very large data sets.


This repository offers various assignments that I completed for Deep Learning course at SJSU. You can go through various Deep learning notebooks to get a better idea of the diversity of this course. Going through these notebooks will clear your DNN concepts.
