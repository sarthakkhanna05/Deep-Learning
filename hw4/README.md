Using available pre-trained models for object detection, conduct inference on a short video (5-10 seconds) of a street scene drawing bounding boxes around detected vehicles.

 

Step 1. Collect a source video. It may be necessary to divide the video into discrete image frames.

Step 2. Conduct inference on each frame of the video, drawing bounding boxes around detected vehicles.

Step 3. Format the results back into a video.
